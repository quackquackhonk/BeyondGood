---------- Interfaces ------------------------
IWorkSheetModel:
	- This interface is parameterized by the user's implementation of "cell contents". Therefore future models that 
	  represent their cells differently should work.

	- Contains all methods that should work on any representation of a spreadsheet.

CellContents:
	- Classes that implement this interface represent possible types of cells.
	- Includes implementations for cells that hold Strings, Doubles, Booleans, Formulas, and rectangular regions of other cells.

IEvalVisitor:
	- Interface to handle evaluation of every type of CellContents.  
	  Needed to call CellContents specific methods.

	- All methods return a Value class (Str, Dbl, Bool), as these are what ALL cells must evaluate too.
		- All formulas eventually return either a String, Double, or Boolean.
		- Returns Value so other methods can store method result without knowing end type.

Value: 
	- Exists to contain base types of CellContents: Strs, Dbls, and Bools.


-------- Abstract Classes --------------------------
Ops:
	- Cells that are Formulas implement the abstract class Ops.
	- Abstracted because all Formulas are constructed with a list of CellContents.
	- getRaw() method is also the same for Ops.
	- All classes that implemetn Ops throw an exception if the types of their arguments are incorrect.



------- Classes --------------------------------------
Bool imp Value: 
	- A CellContents to represent booleans.

Dlb imp Value: 
	- A CellContents to represent doubles.

Str imp Value: 
	- A CellContents to represent Strings.

ReferenceCell imp CellContents:
	- A CellContents to represent a rectangular region of cells.
	- Stores the referenced cells as Coords.

SUM imp Ops:
	- Represents a cell that computes the sum of other CellContents.
	- Holds the CellContents it intends to sum as a field.

PRODUCT imp Ops:
	- Represents a cell that computes the product of other CellContents.
	- Holds the CellContents it intends to multiply as a field.

LESSTHAN imp Ops:
	- Represents a cell that computes if its first number is less than its second.
	- Holds the CellContents it intends to compare as a field.

GREATERTHAN imp Ops:
	- Represents a cell that computes if its first number is greater than its second.
	- Holds the CellContents it intends to compare as a field.

WorkSheetModel imp IWorkSheetModel:
	- The spreadsheet model class. 
	- Supports cells that store values, as well as cells that are formulas
	- Cells can be created as well as updated
	- Cells can be evaluated

WorkSheetModel.SheetBuilder imp WorkSheetBuilder:
	- A builder class for WorkSheetModel
	- Handles creation of initial cells
	- Checks that cells don't create cycles and can be evaluated

SexpVisitParser imp SexpVisitor:
	- Visitor to create corresponding CellContent from SExpressions
	- Assumes "=" has been caught. CellContents could be a ReferenceCell or Ops.

SexpVisitParserSymbol:
	- Visitor to create corresponding CellContent from SExpressions
	- Assumes "=" hasn't been caught. The only valid SSymbols are ReferenceCells.

SexpVisitParserListOne:
	- Visitor to create corresponding CellContent from SExpressions
	- Collapses single length lists to one CellContent
