We were able to implement all the features required by the provider code.
This was accomplished using adapter classes for our model, cell, and controller classes, without making changes to our
implementations.

Features that work with their view (These are all the features required):
	- Infinite scrolling
	- Window resizing
	- Adding new cells with or without errors
	- Displaying cycle or evaluation errors without crashing the program
	- Highliting cells by mouse
	- Cancel changes to a cell and revert to previous cell text



Additional features that our view has (that still work):
	- Moving the selected cell by keyboard
	- Removing cells with the delete key
